Here is my fun journey of solving challenges in adventofcode2021.  

Each day  has the following files
1. `instructions.txt`
2. `test.txt`
3. `input.txt`
4. `challenge1.py`
5. `challenge2.py`

## `instructions.txt`

This file holds the instructions on how to do the challenges. It has both part 1 and 2 in it.

## `test.txt`

This file has the sample test used in the instructions to explain the challenge.  

## `input.txt`

This file contains the actual data supposed to be feed onto the program to compute results fed to the platform to obtain stars.  
The data is unique to each user and requires you to be logged in. I am simply opening this data and copying it to a txt file called input.txt.

## `challenge1.py`

This has the actual python code to solve part one of the challenge.  You have to solve this part inorder to unlock part 2

## `challenge2.py`

This has the actual python code to solve part two of the challenge.
